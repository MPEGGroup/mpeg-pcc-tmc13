General options
---------------

### `--help`
Print a list of available command line (and configuration file) options
along with their default values and exit.

### `--config=FILE`, `-c`
This specifies a configuration file to be immediately loaded.

### `--mode=VALUE`
This option selects the codec's mode of operation.  A value of 0 enables
encoding functionality.  A value of 1 switches to decoding mode.


I/O parameters
--------------

### `--firstFrameNum=INT-VALUE`
The initial frame number of the input or output sequence.
The software replaces any instance of a '%d' printf format directive
with the current frame number when evaluating the following options:

- uncompressedDataPath
- reconstructedDataPath
- postRecolourPath
- preInvScalePath

NB: When decoding, this option relates only to the output file names.

In order to have the decoder produce identically numbered output ply
files as the encoder input, specify the same value of firstFrameNum for
the decoder.

### `--frameCount=INT-VALUE`
(Encoder only)
The number of frames to be encoded.

### `--uncompressedDataPath=FILE`
(Encoder only)
The input source point cloud to be compressed.  The first instance of
'%d' in FILE will be expanded with the current frame number.

### `--compressedStreamPath=FILE`
The compressed bitstream file output when encoding or input when decoding.

### `--reconstructedDataPath=FILE`
The reconstructed point cloud file.  When encoding, the output is the
locally decoded picture.  It is expected that the reconstructed output
of the encoder and decoder match exactly.

The first instance of '%d' in FILE will be expanded with the current
frame number.

### `--postRecolourPath=FILE`
(Encoder only)
As part of the encoding process, it may be necessary to re-colour the
point cloud if the point geometry is altered.  This diagnostic output
file corresponds to the re-coloured point cloud prior to attribute
coding without output geometry scaling.

The first instance of '%d' in FILE will be expanded with the current
frame number.

### `--preInvScalePath=FILE`
(Decoder only)
This diagnostic output corresponds to the decoded point cloud (geometry
and attributes) prior to output geometry scaling.

When compared to the output of `postRecolourPath`, the performance of
attribute coding may be directly measured without being confounded
by any geometry losses.

The first instance of '%d' in FILE will be expanded with the current
frame number.

### `--outputBinaryPly=0|1`
Sets the output format of PLY files (Binary=1, ASCII=0).  Reading and
writing binary PLY files is more efficient than the ASCII variant,
but are less suited to simple scripts and direct human inspection.

If outputting non-integer point co-ordinates (eg, due to the output
geometry scaling), the precision of the binary and ASCII versions are
not identical.

### `--outputSystem=0|1`
Controls the output scaling of the coded point cloud.

  | Value | Description                 |
  |:-----:| ----------------------------|
  | 0     | Conformance output          |
  | 1     | External co-ordinate system |

The conformance output scales the coded point cloud to the sequence
co-ordinate system.  The output point positions are not offset by the
sequence origin.

The external co-ordinate system output scales the point cloud to the
defined external co-ordinate system (see `sequenceScale`, `externalScale`,
and `outputUnitLength`).  The output point positions are offset by the
sequence origin, appropriately scaled.

### `--outputUnitLength=REAL-VALUE`
The length of the output point cloud unit vector.  Point clouds output by
the encoder or decoder are rescaled to match this length.

For example, `outputUnitLength=1000` outputs a point cloud with integer
point positions representing millimetres.

### `--outputPrecisionBits=INT-VALUE`
The number of fractional bits to retain when scaling from the coding
co-ordinate system to the sequence co-ordinate system.  The fractional
bits are further retained when converting to the external co-ordinate
system.

The special value `outputPrecisionBits=-1` retains all fractional bits
during the scaling process.

### `--convertPlyColourspace=0|1`
Controls the conversion of ply RGB colour attributes to/from the
colourspace set by an attribute's `colourMatrix` before attribute
coding and after decoding.  When disabled (0), or if there is no
converter available for the requested `colourMatrix`, no conversion
happens; however the `colourMatrix` value is still written to the
bitstream.


Decoder-specific options
========================

### `--skipOctreeLayers=INT-VALUE`
The option indicates the number of skipped lod layers from leaf lod.
If aps.scalable_enable_flag is 1, the option is valid.
Otherwise, the option is ignored.

### `--decodeMaxPoints=INT-VALUE`
A value greater than zero controls the automatic derivation of
`skipOctreeLayers` such that at most $n$ points are decoded.
This option only has an effect if the bitstream contains per octree level
point count metadata (see `pointCountMetadata`).


Encoder-specific options
========================

Co-ordinate systems and pre-scaling
-----------------------------------

### `--srcUnit=0|1|metre`
The physical unit used to interpret values of `srcUnitLength`.

  | Value   | Description    |
  |:-------:| ---------------|
  | 0       | dimensionless  |
  | 1,metre | metre          |

### `--srcUnitLength=REAL-VALUE`
The length of the source point cloud unit vector.  This value is used to
define the unit vector length of the sequence co-ordinate system.  It is
not used to perform scaling by the encoder.

For example, `srcUnitLength=1000` and `srcUnit=metre` indicates that
integer positions in the source point cloud represent millimetres.

### `--inputScale=REAL-VALUE`
A scale factor applied to point positions in the source point cloud prior
to integer conversion.  The `inputScale` changes the length of the source
unit vectors (as set by `srcUnitLength`).

For example, a point cloud may have a unit vector representing 1 metre
(`srcUnitLength=1`) and contain points with a resolution of 1000 points per
metre.  Since the codec can only represent integer positions, without input
scaling, it is coded with a precision of one metre.
Setting `inputScale=1000` will increase the precision to 1 millimetre.

### `--codingScale=REAL-VALUE`
A scale factor used to determine the length of the coding co-ordinate
system unit vector.  The scale factor is relative to `inputScale`.  The
input point cloud (after integer conversion) is scaled by `codingScale`
and rounded to integer positions.

If `codingScale` is greater than `sequenceScale`, the encoder will set
`codingScale=sequenceScale`.

A decoder will scale the coded point cloud by `sequenceScale/codingScale`
prior to output.

### `--sequenceScale=REAL-VALUE`
A scale factor used to determine the length of the sequence co-ordinate
system unit vector.  The scale factor is relative to `inputScale`.  The
input point cloud (after integer conversion) is scaled by the smallest of
`sequenceScale` and `codingScale`.

### `--externalScale=REAL-VALUE`
A scale factor used to define the length of the sequence co-ordinate system
when `srcUnit` is dimensionless.  The scale factor is relative to `inputScale`.
The `externalScale` does not affect scaling of the input point cloud prior
to coding.

For example, a point cloud coded with `sequenceScale=0.25` and
`externalScale=0.5` specifies that:

- the input is scaled by 0.25 prior to coding, and
- the decoder is informed that 1 sequence unit is equal to 2 external units.

NB: a decoder is not required to scale the sequence co-ordinate system to an
external co-ordinate system prior to output.

### `--autoSeqBbox=0|1`
Automatically determine the sequence bounding box (`seqOrigin` and
`seqSizeWhd`) using the first input frame.

### `--seqOrigin=x,y,z`
Sets the origin of the sequence bounding box.  The `seqOrigin` must be less
than or equal to the lowest input point position.  The origin is configured
in the input co-ordinate system (after integer conversion).  The encoder
will adjust the origin according to `sequenceScale`.

This option has no effect when `autoSeqBbox=1`.

### `--seqSizeWhd=w,h,d`
Sets the size of the sequence bounding box.  The size is configured
in the input co-ordinate system (after integer conversion).  The encoder
will adjust the size according to `sequenceScale`.

`seqSizeWhd=0,0,0` disables signalling the sequence bounding box size.

This option has no effect when `autoSeqBbox=1`.

### `--mergeDuplicatedPoints=0|1`
Controls the ability to code duplicate points.  When duplicate point
merging is enabled, bitstream syntax related to duplicate points is
disabled and a pre-filtering process is used to remove co-located points.

### `--sortInputByAzimuth=0|1`
Pre-sort the input point cloud according to azimuth angle with the
origin `lidarHeadPosition`.  Pre-sorting occurs prior to tile/slice
partitioning.

Input partitioning (slices & tiles)
-----------------------------------

### `--partitionMethod=0|2|3|4|5`
Selects the partitioning method to map points to tiles and slices:

  | Value | Description                             |
  |:-----:| ----------------------------------------|
  | 0     | none (single slice)                     |
  | 2     | uniform partitioning along longest edge |
  | 3     | uniform octree partitions               |
  | 4     | uniform square partitions               |
  | 5     | n-point spans                           |

Uniform longest edge partitioning slices the point cloud along the
longest edge according to `partitionNumUniformGeom`.

Uniform octree partitioning generates slices with the same size
based on an octree partitioning of the point cloud according to
`partitionOctreeDepth`.

Uniform square partitioning generates cubic slices sized according
to the shortest edge.

N-point span partitioning divides the input point list (after input
pre-sorting) into `sliceMaxPoints`-point sublists.  Input order (after
pre-sorting) is maintained.

In all cases, a refinement process may merge or split slices in
order to satisfy maximum or minimum points per slice constraints.

### `--partitionNumUniformGeom=INT-VALUE`
Sets the number of slices to generate using `partitionMethod=2`.
If equal to zero, the number of slices is the integer ratio of the
longest to shortest edges of the point cloud bounding box.

### `--partitionOctreeDepth=INT-VALUE`
Sets the depth of the octree for slice generation using
`partitionMethod=3`.

The input point cloud is decomposed using an octree with the configured
depth.  Each occupied leaf of the octree represents a single slice.

### `--sliceMaxPoints=INT-VALUE`
Upper limit to the number of in each slice.  Slices are split until
this constraint is satisfied.

### `--sliceMinPoints=INT-VALUE`
Minimum number of points in each slice.  This soft limit is used to
merge small slices together.

### `--tileSize=INT-VALUE`
Tile dimension to use when performing initial partitioning.  A value of zero
disables tile partitioning.


General options
---------------

### `--geometry_axis_order=INT-VALUE`
Configures the order in which axes are internally coded.  Changing
the axis order does not change the orientation of the reconstructed
point cloud.

  | Value | Coding order |
  |:-----:| -------------|
  | 0     | z, y, x      |
  | 1     | x, y, z      |
  | 2     | x, z, y      |
  | 3     | y, z, x      |
  | 4     | z, y, x      |
  | 5     | z, x, y      |
  | 6     | y, x, z      |
  | 7     | x, y, z      |

### `--disableAttributeCoding=0|1`
This option instructs the encoder to ignore all options relating to
attribute coding, as if they had never been configured.

### `--enforceLevelLimits=0|1`
Controls the enforcement of level limits by the encoder.  If a level
limit is voilated, the encoder will abort.

### `--cabac_bypass_stream_enabled_flag=0|1`
Controls the entropy coding method used for equi-probable (bypass) bins:

  | Value | Description                           |
  |:-----:| --------------------------------------|
  | 0     | bypass bins coded using CABAC         |
  | 1     | bypass bins coded in bypass substream |

### `--entropyContinuationEnabled=0|1`
Controls the propagation of entropy coding state (context values) between
slices in the same frame.  When enabled, each slice (except the first) has
a coding dependency on the previous slice.


Geometry coding
---------------

### `--geomTreeType=0|1`
Selects the geometry tree coding method.

  | Value | Description              |
  |:-----:| -------------------------|
  | 0     | Octree                   |
  | 1     | Predictive geometry tree |

### `--positionQuantisationEnabled=0|1`
Enables in-loop quantisation and reconstruction of geometry positions.

NB: All in-loop quantisation is independent (and happens after) any
position scaling due to `positionQuantizationScale`.

### `--positionQuantisationMethod=0|1|2`
Selects the method used to determine the QP value for each quantised
tree node.

  | Value | Description      |
  |:-----:| ---------------- |
  | 0     | Uniform          |
  | 1     | Random           |
  | 2     | By point density |

The 'uniform' method sets every node QP to the slice QP.

The 'random' method picks a uniformly distributed random QP for each node from
the range of permitted values.  The seed for random number generation may
be set using the environment variable `SEED`.

The 'point density' method varies the per-node qp according to the relative
number of points in each node.  The sparsest 5% of nodes use $sliceQp +
qpPot$, the densest 40% of nodes use $sliceQp - qpPot$, and the remaining
nodes use $sliceQp$, where qpPot is `8 >> positionQpMultiplierLog2`.

### `--positionBaseQp=INT-VALUE`
The quantisation parameter used to quantise geometry positions.  The
effective QP may be varied according to `positionSliceQpOffset` and
`positionQuantisationOctreeDepth`.
A QP equal to 0 results in a scale factor of 1.

### `--positionQpMultiplierLog2=0|1|2|3`
Controls the granularity of quantisation step sizes by limiting the number
of QP values per step size doubling interval.  There are $2^n$ QPs per
step size doubling interval.

### `--positionIdcmQp=INT-VALUE`
The quantisation parameter used to quantise directly coded (IDCM) point
positions prior to reaching the `positionQuantisationOctreeDepth`.

### `--positionSliceQpOffset=INT-VALUE`
A per-slice offset to be applied to `positionBaseQp`.

### `--positionQuantisationOctreeDepth=INT-VALUE`
The depth in the octree at which per-node QP offsets are signalled.
A non-normative encoder process determines the QP offset based upon
the local density of the octree.  A value of -1 disables signalling
of per-node QP offsets.

### `--positionQuantisationSizeLog2=INT-VALUE`
Sets the depth at which per-node QP offsets are signalled.  The depth
is the tree level with the configured node size.  This value, if greater
than 0, overrides `positionQuantisationOctreeDepth`.

When non-cubic nodes are present, the depth is the tree level with the
minimum node size dimension.

### `qtbtEnabled=0|1`
Enables non-cubic geometry tree coding.  When enabled, the geometry
tree may have a cuboid bounding box.  The partitioning of internal tree
nodes at a particular depth are determined non-normatively by the encoder
to be one of octree, quadtree or binary partitions.

### `maxNumQtBtBeforeOt=INT-VALUE`
Limits the maximal number of quadtree and binary tree partitions used before
the first octree partition.

### `minQtbtSizeLog2=INT-VALUE`
Specifies the minimum size of quadtree and binary tree partitions.

### `--bitwiseOccupancyCoding=0|1`
In octree geometry coding, there are both byte-wise and bit-wise tools to
encode the occupancy data.  This option selects between the two methods.

### `--neighbourAvailBoundaryLog2=INT-VALUE`
Defines the volume within which octree nodes are considered available
for use in occupancy contextualisation and intra occupancy prediction.

A value less than 2 limits the use of neighbouring nodes to direct octree
siblings.

The software currently supports a maximum value of 8 or 9 when
intra occupancy prediction is enabled or disabled respectively.

### `--inferredDirectCodingMode=0|1|2|3`
Controls the degree to which early termination of the geometry octree is
used to code isolated points.

 | Value | Extent of qualifying node criteria   |
 |:-----:| -------------------------------------|
 | 0     | Disabled                             |
 | 1     | Fully isolated parent and child      |
 | 2     | Partially isolated parent            |
 | 3     | Unconstrained                        |

### `--jointTwoPointIdcm=0|1`
Controls the method used to code the point positions of directly coded
nodes containing two distinct points.  When enabled, an implicit point order
is used to improve coding efficiency.

### `--adjacentChildContextualization=0|1`
Controls the contextualization of occupancy bits according to the
state of adjacent children of neighbouring nodes.

### `--intra_pred_max_node_size_log2=INT-VALUE`
Intra occupancy prediction uses an octree node's neighbours to predict
its occupancy.  The prediction mode is enabled for octree nodes smaller
than or equal to the configured size.  A value of 0 disables intra
occupancy prediction.

### `--planarEnabled=0|1`
Controls the use of planar coding mode for geometry occupancy.

### `--planarModeIdcmUse=0--32`
Controls the frequency in 1/32 percent of IDCM eligibility.  Set to zero,
IDCM is disabled.  Set to 32, IDCM is unconstrained.

### `--planarModeThreshold0=0--127`
Controls the eligibility threshold of the first planar mode based upon
local child node density.

### `--planarModeThreshold1=0--127`
Controls the eligibility threshold of the second planar mode based upon
local child node density.

### `--planarModeThreshold2=0--127`
Controls the eligibility threshold of the third planar mode based upon
local child node density.

### `--angularEnabled=0|1`
Controls the use of the angular coding mode in geometry occupancy
contextualisation.  Angular coding mode uses a LiDaR head model prior to
improve the compression of a LiDaR acquired point cloud.  The angular
mode requires that planar mode is enabled.

### `--lidarHeadPosition=x,y,z`
Specifies the LiDaR head position for use by the angular mode in terms
of the input (unquantised) point cloud co-ordinate system.

### `--numLasers=0--255`
The number of known laser angles and positions for use in angular mode.

### `--lasersTheta=FLOAT-VALUE-LIST`
The tangent of the elevation angle of each known laser used by the angular
mode.  The zero value of laserTheta describes a horizontal laser.  
Positive values of laserTheta represent an elevation above the horizontal.  
Negative values of laserTheta represent an elevation below the horizontal.

The software will convert the floating point angles to an 18 bit fixed
point representation.

### `--lasersZ=FLOAT-VALUE-LIST`
The vertical offset of each known laser used by the angular mode.
Each offset is expressed along the z axis in the input point cloud
co-ordinate system, corresponding to a vertical offset relative to
the LiDAR head position.

The software will convert the floating point offsets to a three bit
fixed point representation.

### `--lasersNumPhiPerTurn=INT-VALUE-LIST`
The maximum number of samples that can be acquired during a full rotation of
each known laser used by the angular mode.

### `--planarBufferDisabled=0|1`
Controls the deactivation of the planar mode buffer for angular mode.

### `--numOctreeEntropyStreams=INT-VALUE`
The number of geometry sub-streams (suitable for parallel coding) used
to encode the geometry octree.  For example, a value of eight generates
eight sub-streams, one for the initial tree, then one for each of the
last seven tree levels.

No parallel sub-streams are generated when *VALUE* is 1.

NB: the reference software does not attempt to exploit any opportunities
for parallelism generated by this feature.

### `--trisoupNodeSizeLog2=INT-VALUE|INT-VALUE-LIST`
Controls the use of trisoup by setting the node size for triangle
based surface reconstruction.  The trisoup method terminates the
octree coding at the given node size and continues by encoding
triangles which are subsequently voxelised to produce points.

A value less than 2 disables the use of trisoup.

When a list of values is used, the n-th entry in the list controls the
configuration of the n-th slice.  The last entry is mapped to all remaining
slices.

### `--trisoup_sampling_value=INT-VALUE`
Controls the number of points generated by the trisoup triangle
voxelisation process.  Larger values reduce the number of points
generated per triangle.

 | Value | Description                    |
 |:-----:| -------------------------------|
 | 0     | automatic (default)            |
 | 1     | no sub-sampling                |
 | N >=1 | point sampling period          |

The automatic mode will find the smallest sampling value that such that
the number of generated points does not exceed the slice limit set by
`sliceMaxPoints`.

### `--predGeomSort=INT-VALUE`
Point order used to construct predictive geometry trees.
Requires `geomTreeType=1`.

 | Value | Description     |
 |:-----:| ----------------|
 | 0     | none            |
 | 1     | morton order    |
 | 2     | azimuth angle   |
 | 3     | radial distance |

### `--predGeomAzimuthSortPrecision=INT-VALUE`
Controls the precision used in azimuthal sorting of points prior to
predictive tree construction.  A value of 0 represents full-precision,
otherwise larger values represent increasing precision.
Requires `predGeomSort=2`.

### `--predGeomTreePtsMax=INT-VALUE`
Maximum number of points per predictive geometry tree.  A slice may contain
more than one predictive geometry tree.
Requires `geomTreeType=1`.

### `--positionBaseQpFreqLog2=INT-VALUE`
Controls the number of predictive geometry tree nodes scaled by the same
QP offset instance.  QP offsets are signalled every $2^n$ nodes in tree
traversal order.  This configuration applies to all slices.
Requires `positionQuantisationEnabled=1`.

### `--positionSliceQpFreqLog2=INT-VALUE`
Identical to `positionBaseQpFreqLog2`, but controls per-slice configuration.

### `--positionAzimuthScaleLog2=INT-VALUE`
Number of additional bits used to represent predictive geometry azimuth
angles.  Requires `angularEnabled=1`.

### `--positionRadiusInvScaleLog2=INT-VALUE`
Degree of quantisation applied in the representation of angular predictive
geometry radial distances.
Requires `angularEnabled=1`.

### `--positionAzimuthSpeed=INT-VALUE`
Step size used to linearly model progression of per-laser azimuthal angles
during angular predictive geometry coding.
Requires `angularEnabled=1`.

### `--pointCountMetadata=0|1`
Controls the addition of per octree layer point count metadata to each
geometry slice.


Attribute coding
----------------

The codec may be configured to represent one or more attributes.
The configuration of each attribute is independent from all others.
To configure coding of an attribute, first set the attribute options,
then save the configuration using the `attribute` option.

### `--attribute=NAME`
Saves the current attribute configuration for coding the named attribute.

  | Name        | Description |
  |:----------- |---|
  | colour      | r, g, and b properties as a tri-stimulus attribute |
  | reflectance | refc or reflectance property as a single-stimulus attribute |

This option must be specified after the options corresponding to
the attribute.

### `--defaultValue=INT-VALUE-LIST`
The default value to use for attribute data in case of data loss.  If
unset, the implicit default attribute value is 2**(bitdepth-1).

### `--colourMatrix=INT-VALUE`
Indicates the colourspace of the coded attribute values according to
the ISO/IEC 23001-8 Codec Independent Code Points for ColourMatrix.
When used in conjunction with `convertPlyColourspace=1`, a colourspace
conversion will be performed at the input/output of the encoder and
decoder if supported.

  | Value | RGB converter | Description                               |
  |:-----:|:-------------:|------------------------------------------ |
  | 0     | n/a           | Direct coding (eg, RGB, XYZ)              |

  | 6     | No            | YCbCr SMPTE 170M                          |
  | 7     | No            | YCbCr SMPTE 240M                          |
  | 8     | Yes (YCgCoR)  | YCgCo / YCgCoR                            |
  | 9     | No            | YCbCr ITU-R BT.2020                       |
  | 10    | No            | YCbCr ITU-R BT.2020 (constant luminance)  |
  | 11    | No            | YDzDx SMPTE ST 2085                       |

NB: the use of YCgCoR and `bitdepth=N` implies that the bitdepth of the
chroma component bitdepth is N + 1.

### `--bitdepth=INT-VALUE`
The bitdepth of the attribute data.  NB, this is not necessarily the
same as the bitdepth of the PLY property.

### `--attrScale=INT-VALUE` and `--attrOffset=INT-VALUE`
Scale and offset used to interpret coded attribute values.

The encoder derives the coded attribute value as $(attr - offset) / scale$.

The encoder and decoder scale coded attributes for output as
$attr × scale + offset$.

NB: these parameters are only supported for reflectance attributes.

### `--transformType=0|1|2`
Coding method to use for the current attribute:

  | Value | Description                                                |
  |:-----:| ---------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 0     | Region Adaptive Hierarchical Transform (RAHT)              |
  | 1     | Hierarchical neighbourhood prediction                      |
  | 2     | Hierarchical neighbourhood prediction as lifting transform |
  | 3     | Uncompressed (PCM)                                         |

### `--rahtPredictionEnabled=0|1`
Controls the use of transform domain prediction of RAHT coefficients
from spatially upsampling the DC values of neighbouring parent nodes
in the transform tree.

### `--rahtPredictionThreshold0=0--19`
Controls a per-block threshold used to enable or disable the transform
domain prediction of RAHT coefficients.  This threshold specifies
the number of parent neighbour points that must be present.

### `--rahtPredictionThreshold1=0--19`
Controls a per-block threshold used to enable or disable the transform
domain prediction of RAHT coefficients.  This threshold specifies

Controls the use of the neighbour average predictor when direct prediction
is invoked.

### `--interComponentPredictionEnabled=0|1`
Controls the use of an in-loop inter-component prediction of attribute
residuals.  When enabled, the secondary attribute residuals (e.g. red/blue)
are predicted from the primary component (e.g. green).

Applies to `transformType=0` and `attribute=color` only.

### `--lastComponentPredictionEnabled=0|1`
Controls the use of an in-loop inter-component prediction of attribute
coefficients.  When enabled, the coefficient of the last component (e.g. Cr)
of the secondary attribute is predicted from the corresponding first
component (e.g. Cb) according to a simple model.

Applies to `transformType=2` and `attribute=color` only.

### `--intraLoDSearchRange=INT-VALUE`
Buffer range searched for nearest neighbours within the same level of detail.
The value -1 configures a full-range search.
The value 0 disables the intra level of detail search.

Buffer range searched for nearest neighbours between different levels of
detail.  The value -1 configures a full-range search.

### `--max_num_direct_predictors=INT-VALUE`
Maximum number of nearest neighbour candidates used in direct
attribute prediction.

### `--lodDecimator=0|1|2`
Controls the level-of-detail generation method:

  | Value | Description                                             |
  |:-----:| ------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 0     | No decimation is performed                              |
  | 1     | Decimation by periodic lodSubsamplingPeriod             |
  | 1     | Decimation by distance to lodSubsamplingPeriod centroid |

### `--intraLodPredictionSkipLayers=INT-VALUE`
The number of detail levels where intra prediction is disabled, starting
from the finest detail level.  Applies to `transformType=0` only.

  | Value | Description                             |
  |:-----:| --------------------------------------- |
  | -1    | Disabled in all detail levels           |
  |  0    | Enabled in all detail levels            |
  |  n    | Disabled in n finest detail levels      |

### `--aps_scalable_enabled_flag=0|1`
Enable spatially scalable attribute encoding.
The option is only valid when `transformType=2`, `positionQpMultiplierLog2=3`,
`lodDecimator=0`, and `trisoupNodeSizeLog2=0`.

### `--max_neigh_range=INT-VALUE`
Limits the distance between a point and the neighbours used for its
prediction. The maximum distance is expressed in units of node diagonals
and is scaled according to the current level of detail.

### `--levelOfDetailCount=INT-VALUE`
Attribute's number of levels of detail.

### `--dist2=INT-VALUE`
An initial squared distances used to generate successive levels of detail.
When equal to zero, an initial value is automatically determined.

### `--dist2PercentileEstimate=FLOAT-VALUE`
Percentile of per-point nearest neighbour distances used to estimate `dist2`.

### `--positionQuantizationScaleAdjustsDist2=0|1`
Adjusts `dist2` according to `sequenceScale`.  This option simplifies the
specification of the per-attribute `dist2` parameter.

The squared distance threshold used for generating levels-of-detail in
attribute coding is dependent on the point cloud density and is therefore
affected by geometry quantization.  When this parameter is enabled,
`dist2` values are scaled by `sequenceScale` squared, thereby
allowing `dist2` to be specified as an intrinsic property of the source
sequence.

### `--lodSubsamplingPeriod=INT-VALUE|INT-VALUE-LIST`
A list of sampling periods used to generate successive levels of detail.

### `--canonical_point_order_flag=0|1`
Controls the order used for attribute coding.  The canonical (geometry
decoding order) is usable only with LoD attribute coding and
`levelOfDtailCount=0`.

  | Value | Description                        |
  |:-----:| ---------------------------------- |
  | 0     | Morton order                       |
  | 1     | Decoded geometry (canonical) order |

### `--spherical_coord_flag=0|1`
Controls the conversion of point co-ordinates used in attribute coding from
the Cartesian domain to a scaled spherical domain.

### `--lod_neigh_bias=INT-VALUE-LIST`

Attribute's per layer luma QP offsets.  A layer is corresponds to a
level-of-detail or RAHT transform block.

### `--qpLayerOffsetsChroma=INT-VALUE-LIST`
Attribute's per layer chroma QP offsets.  A layer is corresponds to a
level-of-detail or RAHT transform block.
Only applies when `attribute=colour`.
